Cling is a new and interactive C++11 standard compliant interpreter built on the top of Clang and LLVM compiler infrastructure. Its advantages over the standard interpreters are that it has command line prompt and uses Just In Time (JIT) compiler for compilation. Many of the developers (e.g. Mono in their project called CSharpRepl) of such kind of software applications name them interactive compilers.
