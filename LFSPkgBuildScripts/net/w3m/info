w3m is a World Wide Web (WWW) text based client.

Help is avaliable in English, German and Japanese.  There is
an option menu which can be configured for the chosen
lanugage.

It will display hypertext markup language (HTML) documents
containing links to files residing on the local system, as
well as files residing on remote systems. It can display
HTML tables, frames, and images, and supports tabbed
browsing. In addition, it can be used as a "pager" in much
the same manner as "more" or "less".  w3m can display images
in both the framebuffer, in supported terminals, and the X
server.
