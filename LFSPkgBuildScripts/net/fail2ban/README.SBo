To install custom startup script on LFS do this:
sudo install -m 754 fail2ban /etc/rc.d/init.d/
sudo install -m 754 init-functions /etc/rc.d/init.d/
sudo ln -sf  ../init.d/fail2ban /etc/rc.d/rc0.d/K32fail2ban
sudo ln -sf  ../init.d/fail2ban /etc/rc.d/rc1.d/K32fail2ban
sudo ln -sf  ../init.d/fail2ban /etc/rc.d/rc2.d/S18fail2ban
sudo ln -sf  ../init.d/fail2ban /etc/rc.d/rc3.d/S18fail2ban
sudo ln -sf  ../init.d/fail2ban /etc/rc.d/rc4.d/S18fail2ban
sudo ln -sf  ../init.d/fail2ban /etc/rc.d/rc5.d/S18fail2ban
sudo ln -sf  ../init.d/fail2ban /etc/rc.d/rc6.d/K32fail2ban

Once you install the package, you can start using fail2ban by:
1. chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.fail2ban
2. /etc/rc.d/rc.fail2ban start

Additionally, you can add the following to rc.local for automatic startup
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.fail2ban ]; then
        /etc/rc.d/rc.fail2ban start
fi

and add the following to rc.local_shutdown to stop fail2ban at shutdown
if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.fail2ban ]; then
        /etc/rc.d/rc.fail2ban stop
fi

The package contains logrotate script copied from fail2ban manual,
and modified to reflect Slackware packaging.  You can find
the original script at:

UPGRADING:

Please make sure you have all your modifications done to .local files instead of
.conf files.

Making modifications to .local files is the recommended practice as per the
software manual.  Each .conf file is overridden by equivalent .local file.
Please refer Configuration section in fail2ban manual.
