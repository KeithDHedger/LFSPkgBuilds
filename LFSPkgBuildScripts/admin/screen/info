http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/blfs/view/stable/general/screen.html Screen is a terminal multiplexor that runs several separate processes, typically interactive shells, on a single physical character-based terminal. Each virtual terminal emulates a DEC VT100 plus several ANSI X3.64 and ISO 2022 functions and also provides configurable input and output translation, serial port support, configurable logging, multi-user support, and many character encodings, including UTF-8. Screen sessions can be detached and resumed later on a different terminal.
