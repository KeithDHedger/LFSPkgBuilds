libblockdev is a C library supporting GObject Introspection for manipulation of block devices. It has a plugin-based architecture where each technology (like LVM, Btrfs, MD RAID, Swap,...) is implemented in a separate plugin, possibly with multiple implementations (e.g. using LVM CLI or the new LVM DBus API).
