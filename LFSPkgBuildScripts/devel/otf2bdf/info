otf2bdf (opentype/truetype to bdf font converter)

otf2bdf is a command line utility that uses the FreeType 2 font rendering
library to generate BDF bitmap fonts from OpenType/TrueType outline fonts
at different sizes and resolutions. This program is essentially the same
as the ttf2bdf program except that it uses FreeType 2.*, not FreeType
1.*, has some bug fixes, and includes a new command line parameter to
print out the available encoding tables in the font.
