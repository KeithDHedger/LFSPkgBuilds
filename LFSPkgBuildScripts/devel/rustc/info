The Rust programming language is designed to be a safe, concurrent, practical language.

As with many other programming languages, rustc (the rust compiler) needs a binary from which to bootstrap. It will download a stage0 binary, and several cargo files (these are actually .tar.gz source archives) at the start of the build, so you cannot compile it without an internet connection.

The current rustbuild build-system will use all available processors, although it does not scale well and often falls back to just using one core while waiting for a library to compile.

At the moment Rust does not provide any guarantees of a stable ABI
