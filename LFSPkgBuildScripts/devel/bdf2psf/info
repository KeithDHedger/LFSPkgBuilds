bdf2psf (convert fonts from bdf to psf format)

bdf2psf is a perl script that converts fonts from bdf to psf format.
It can merge glyphs coming from several fonts, use the same
glyph for several characters to save space through equivalence
files, choose which characters to have glyphs included in the psf
font through a list of character sets, output either a font suitable
for a plain text linux console or for a framebuffer.
