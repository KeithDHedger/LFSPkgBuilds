Falkon is a KDE web browser using the QtWebEngine rendering engine. It was previously known as QupZilla. It aims to be a lightweight web browser available through all major platforms.

Although falkon is now part of KDE, it can be installed without KDE (with the loss of kwallet functionality, and of translations of the (not-installed) example hellopython.py script).
