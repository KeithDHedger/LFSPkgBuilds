recode (a Charset converter) The recode program recognizes or produces approximately 150 character sets and can convert almost any character set to almost any other. When exact translations are not possible, the program may get rid of offending characters or use approximations. Particular attention has been paid to the proper representation of French language diacritics. Homepage: https://github.com/pinard/Recode
