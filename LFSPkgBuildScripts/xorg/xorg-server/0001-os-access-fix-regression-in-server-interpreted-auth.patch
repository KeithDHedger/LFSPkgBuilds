Subject: [PATCH] os/access: fix regression in server interpreted auth

This was reported on irc on Fedora when rawhide went to 1.17.1.

regression occured in: 2566835b4374edb3e5a8353d4f7c9e7ec4851c57
 os: Eliminate uninitialized value warnings from access.c

siAddrMatch doesn't need addr to be a useful value, it checks
some things like localuser without having an address at all.
